# UNP_REGRESSION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_BIKE_SHARING_ANALYSIS

As part of my value added course with United Network of Professionals (UNP EDUCATION), I developed a Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Model using Python to forecast daily bike rental counts based on weather, temporal, and user-related factors. The project involved comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, correcting data types, encoding categorical features, and treating outliers using the IQR method. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed strong correlations between bike demand and variables such as temperature, humidity, windspeed, season, and working days. Multiple regression-based machine learning models—Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—were trained and evaluated using various data splits. This project strengthened my skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and visualization, while providing practical experience in applying data science techniques for real-world urban mobility and demand forecasting
